Changelog: 

2.1.9 - Bug fixes.  Fixed issue where language was defaulting to English.
2.1.8 - Bug fixes for crashes and NullPointerExceptions.  Added old widget back in.  The widgets are identifiable by their icons.  Blue-Green is On/Off widget.
		Blue is the new toggle widget.  Ability to choose your language has been added (more will be added in the future).  Tasker can now Enable/Disable the firewall.
2.1.7 - Widget has been replaced with a more functional one since the original gave people way too many problems.
		New notification icon in order to look more like traditional Android notifications.
2.1.6 - Translation updates to French and Chinese. Fix for firewall log always showing empty on some devices.  
		UI clean up.  Many options moved to Settings menu.  VPN/Roaming support now optional and disappear
		if disabled.  Tasker notifications now optional. Profile name changes now appear in Tasker.
		All settings are saved to the rules files.  
2.1.5 - Fix minor issue where checkboxes for VPN are not showing up when the app is re-opened.
2.1.4 - Profile names now editable. Fix for NullPointerException. VPN support has been added. Many thanks to Ventz for all his work 
		with it and randomly supplying me with the exact iptables rules needed to implement the functionality.
		Updated the logging code.  Logs should hold more information now and not get over written as often.  Applying rules
		on boot has been totally re-written.  Hopefully, this corrects any issues with rules applying on boot.  This also
		corrected an issue with some devices on Android 2.x where the app would hang the first time you open it after a reboot.
		Profiles now save changes made to them.  Do not forget to export your rules file though for safe keeping. XHDPI icons added.
2.1.3 - App search.  Widget fixed. Issue where the firewall rules don't work when Mobile Data Limit  is 
		being used has been fixed.
2.1.2 - Tasker/Locale plugin support. 
2.1.1 - Shell script replaced by proper SU binary support with SuperSU binary.  Thanks to Chainfire for a great product and his write up
		"How-to su".  I chose SuperSU over Superuser because of Chainfires write up. In the end either SU versions
		would have worked just fine.  Fixed issue where loading profiles through menu wouldn't properly set the spinner position.
		Update to the French translation, Thanks Joffrey!
2.1.0 - Save/Load Profiles functionality. Spinner option added to main screen for quick swap of profiles. Main menu totally revamped.
		Invert option for WiFi/Data added for those who swap between Blacklist and Whitelist.  Roaming still left up to the user.

		Thanks to Joffrey for French, Alex for Russian and iptux for Chinese, and Hiroki Ogawa for Japanese.

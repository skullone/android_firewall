		with it and randomly supplying me with the exact iptables rules needed to implement the functionality.
		Updated the logging code.  Logs should hold more information now and not get over written as often.  Applying rules
		on boot has been totally re-written.  Hopefully, this corrects any issues with rules applying on boot.  This also
		corrected an issue with some devices on Android 2.x where the app would hang the first time you open it after a reboot.

2.1.1 - Shell script replaced by proper SU binary support with SuperSU binary.  Thanks to Chainfire for a great product and his write up
		"How-to su".  I chose SuperSU over Superuser because of Chainfires write up. In the end either SU versions
		would have worked just fine.  Fixed issue where loading profiles through menu wouldn't properly set the spinner position.
		Update to the French translation, Thanks Joffrey!

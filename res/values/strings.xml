    <string name="help_usage"><b>Using Android Firewall</b>\n<b>1.</b> Click on <b>Mode</b> to switch between <i>White List</i> and <i>Black List</i> modes.
\n<b>2.</b> Mark the applications that you want to block or allow (depending on the selected mode), for each interface.
\n<b>3.</b> Open the menu and enable the firewall. If the firewall is already enabled, just select <b>Apply rules</b>.
\nThe rules will be saved and automatically restored when you restart your phone.
\nIf you want to check all current iptables rules, select <b>Show rules</b> from the Navigation Drawer.
\n
\n<b>Widgets</b>\nTo quickly enable or disable the firewall with a single touch, add the On/Off Widget to your home screen.
\nTo quickly change profiles or enable/disable the firewall, add the Menu Widget to your home screen.
\n
\n<b>Firewall logs</b>\nIf you want to see which applications have been blocked by Android Firewall, open the <i>Settings</i> menu and enable the Log.
\nAndroid Firewall will then log each application blocked. You can check the log by opening the menu and selecting <b>Show log</b> from the Navigation Drawer. 
\nSome newer devices, most notably the Nexus devices, use NFLOG instead of LOG.  Android Firewall now supports both. 
\n
\n<b>Password lock</b>\nYou can set a password lock for Android Firewall by using the <b>Set password</b> option in the Navigation Drawer.
\nTo remove the password protection, just reset it to blank.
\n
\n<b>App search</b>\nYou can search for a specific app by typing the first few letters of the apps name in the search bar next to the spinner.
\n
\n<b>Supported Interfaces</b>\nAlong side the traditional WiFi and Data interfaces, three other interfaces are now supported.  Support for VPNs, Roaming, and LANs are avaiable.  These are enabled under <i>Settings</i>.
\n
\n<i>VPN support</i> allows apps to only access the data stream when connected to a VPN.
\n
\n<i>Roaming support</i> allows apps to access the data stream when you are roaming.
\n
\n<i>LAN support</i> allows apps to access LAN data but not the Internet.  LAN support requries the new <i>Automatic Firewall Rules</i> option in <i>Settings</i> to be enabled.  Please refer to the description for more information.
\n
\n<b>NOTE:</b> <i>Automatic Firewall Rules and LAN support</i> require the Internet permission in order to access the Subnet and LAN address information for each interface.  <b>Android Firewall</b> in no way actually transmits data or accesses the Internet.
\n
\n<i>Tethering support</i> allows you to tether a laptop/tablet/phone to your device without having to disable the firewall.  This is new and improved and no longer requires allowing "apps that run as root" and "kernel".  Bluetooth tethering interfaces are now supported via VPN support in order to maintain better control over the interface names.
\n
\n<b>Tasker/Locale Support</b>\n<i>Android Firewall</i> contains a plugin for Tasker and Locale.  The plugin allows those apps to Enable or Disable the firewall and change profiles based on different variables.  For more information please read the Tasker instructions under the Profiles Help tab.
\nNotifications from Tasker stating changes have been made to the firewall are disabled by default.  They can be enabled under <i>Settings</i>.
\n
\n<b>Other settings</b>\n
\n<i>IPv6 support</i> is available under <i>Settings</i> for those who use IPv6.
\n
\nUsers can change the apps language to one of the supported languages under <i>Settings</i>.
\n
\n<i>SDcard support</i> for users who have moved apps to their SDcard.  Please read the setting description before enabling.
\n
\nUsers can choose which iptables binary they wish to use.  You can use the binary file included in Android Firewall or you can choose to use the system binary file.  This option is under <i>Settings</i>.
\n
\n<b>Information</b>\n
\n<i>Media Server</i> is <b>required</b> for <i>YouTube</i> to function.

    <string name="help_rules"><i>Rules Management</i> is the ability to export, import, and delete rules files.\n  
        \nAll user preferences are stored in the rules file so when you export a rules file you also save your Settings like notification support, log enabled, IPv6 support, and the rest.  These files are used to create your profiles as well.
\n
\n<b>Export Rules</b> exports your current rules and settings.
\n<b>Import Rules</b> imports rules and settings from a file.
\n<b>Manage Rule Files</b> allows you to delete rules files.
\n

\n5.  Touch \'No\' or \'Yes\'.  
\n
\nIf you touch \'Yes\' the rules file is deleted.</string>
    <string name="help_profiles"><i>Profiles</i> are used to quickly change the firewall rules and settings.  This is a very powerful tool as you may want a totally different set of rules depending on where you are or what network you are on.  For example, when at work your rules may be very different compared to when you are home.
\n
\nProfiles are created from rules files that you have exported so you can swap between them quickly and easily if you ever need more than 5 profiles.\n
\n<b>Create Profile</b> allows you to choose a rules file and assign those rules and settings to a profile.
\n<b>Load Profile</b> allows you to apply a profile.
\n<b>Edit Profile Names</b> allows you to edit the names of the profiles in order to make it easier to remember what profile does what.
\n
\nYou can swap profiles in a variety of different ways:
\n
\n<b>1.</b> Manually load a profile by using Load Profile.
\n<b>2.</b> Load a profile by using the dropdown spinner on the main app screen.
\n<b>3.</b> Use an app like Tasker or Locale to automatically change the profile based on time, location, or some other variable you choose.
\n<b>4.</b> Use the <i>Menu Widget</i> to quickly change profiles from your homescreen.
\n
\n<i><b>Instructions</b></i>\n
\n<b>Create Profile</b>\n
\n1.  Swipe left to open the Navigation Drawer.
\n2.  Touch <i>Create Profile</i>.
\n3.  Touch the profile you wish to create.
\n4.  Touch the rules file you want assigned to that profile.

\n
\n<b>Load Profile</b>\n
\n1.  Swipe left to open the Navigation Drawer.
\n2.  Touch <i>Load Profile</i>.
\n3.  Touch the profile you wish to apply.
\n
\n<b>Edit Profile Names</b>\n
\n1.  Swipe left to open the Navigation Drawer.
\n2.  Touch <i>Edit Profile Names</i>.
\n3.  Touch the profile you want to rename.
\n4.  Enter the name for the profile and touch \'OK\'.
\n5.  Continue modifying the names otherwise hit the back key.
\n
\n<b>Using the Spinner</b>\n
\n1.  Touch the spinner and a drop down with all the profiles appears.
\n2.  Touch the profile you wish to load.
\n
\n<b>Using Tasker</b>\n
\n1.  Open Tasker.
\n2.  Touch the \'+\' and select the \'First Context\' for what will cause the profile change.
\n3.  After you done setting up your context you will be prompted to \'Enter Task\'.
\n4.  Enter a name for the task if you desire then touch the checkmark.
\n5.  Touch the \'+\' and a \'Select Action Category\' screen appears.
\n6.  Touch \'Plugin\'.
\n7.  Touch <i>Android Firewall</i>.
\n8.  Touch the \'Edit\' button.
\n9.  Select which profile you want Tasker to apply.
